## My Favorite Quotes!

"This is motivation
For every single chance you ain’t taken
any rule that’s in your way you better break it
Shut up, embrace it
The pain is a pre-requisite without it how the fuck you think you Ever gon’ make it" - Dax

"Im the one who put myself here
I’m the one who told the devil fuck off it’s only god I fear
I’m one who put the stars into alignment, had a Dream and then collided it with work and then I named it perfect timing
I’m the one that Fell down, bounced back, relapsed, got lapped, reclassed but never fell off track
Fighting demons in the evening overnight while I was cleaning $7.25 an hour was the wage no cap
I am definition I don’t lack skill I lack recognition I don’t have dreams I have premonitions every single word I spit is ammunition gassing on the competition never break a sweat this shit is practice like an exhibition" - Dax

"I’m already crazy, 1/4 of me is all of you so half of me is two of you and 4 of you is all me, you’ll need a whole army if you thinking bout stopping me and 5 lifetimes if you’re thinking you can copy me
I’ve beaten poverty went to war and beat mediocrity my life is mine I’m molding that shit like I’m doing pottery
I’m not scared of failure I embrace it and chase it 
If there’s a 1 percent chance I can do it I take it
I took the hate they all threw sat down and I ate" - Dax

"Rejection makes a man stronger. I believe you can't call yourself a real man unless you can laugh off all the bad stuff that's happend to you." - Jiraiya

"If you have everything, you have nothing but if you have nothing, you have everything so spend your time wisely!" - Me
